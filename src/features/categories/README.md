# Categories Feature Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations applied to the Categories feature.

## API Layer Optimizations

1. **Request Caching**
   - Implemented a local in-memory cache for category data using a Map
   - Cached API requests with a 30-second expiration to reduce redundant network calls
   - Used request parameter stringification as cache keys

2. **Optimized API Payload**
   - Conditionally using FormData only when needed (for image uploads)
   - Using JSON payloads for better performance when no files are being uploaded
   - Improved request parameter building with dedicated helper functions

## React Query Optimizations

1. **Improved Query Configuration**
   - Set appropriate staleTime (5 minutes) to reduce unnecessary refetches
   - Added gcTime (10 minutes) for better garbage collection
   - Disabled automatic refetching on window focus

2. **Targeted Query Invalidation**
   - More precise cache invalidation strategies
   - Using specific query keys for better cache control
   - Removing specific data from cache when it's deleted

## React Component Optimizations

1. **Memoization**
   - Added memo() to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components
   - Used React.memo for both container and presentational components
   - Added displayName properties for better debugging

2. **UseCallback and UseMemo**
   - Applied useCallback to event handlers to prevent recreation on each render
   - Used useMemo for expensive computations like date formatting and string processing
   - Added dependency arrays to optimize when recalculations occur

3. **Image Optimizations**
   - Added lazy loading for images to improve initial load time
   - Properly cleaning up object URLs to prevent memory leaks
   - Used smaller components with focused responsibilities

## Form Handling Optimizations

1. **Form Reset and Cleanup**
   - Improved form reset logic with proper cleanup
   - Added effect hooks to release resources when components unmount
   - Better error handling with specific error types

2. **State Management**
   - More efficient state updates with functional state updates
   - Properly typed all components and API responses
   - Added loading indicators and proper data fetching states

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

1. **Implementation of Virtualized Lists**
   - For handling large numbers of categories efficiently

2. **Image Compression**
   - Client-side image compression before upload

3. **Progressive Loading**
   - Implement skeleton loaders for better perceived performance

4. **Pagination Optimization**
   - Prefetching next page data for smoother pagination

5. **Error Boundary Implementation**
   - Add React error boundaries to prevent entire app crashes
